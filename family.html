			<h5>My Family Background</h5>
			<br><p5>Family is my main strength in getting on with life because without them I would quickly give up and not want to do good things for myself and others. So, in line with the title above, I will tell you a little bit about my family background and introduce each member of my family to all readers. Let's get started!</p5></br> 
			<br><p5>My father's name is Nor Azizi bin Jiran. He was born on January 4, 1974 in Selangor but grew up in Pahang. My father works in a factory as a Quality Management. My father is a good man because he always carries out his responsibilities as a father and never scolds his children unless his children are not doing their best in studies or commiting mistakes that could have a negative impact on themselves. My father was also a diligent in cook and planted flowers. Sometimes, he often told me and my sister to plant, yet we often avoided because we didn't want to do the activity. He is also often gives advice and reminders to be independent woman and good at earning their own money.</p5></br>
			<br><p5>Now, I will introduce my mother. My mother's name is Azurah binti Mohd Saleh. She was born on October 21, 1975. My mother is a housewife but she is very good at making money. Various businesses done by my mother so that she had her own money and could meet all the wants of herself and her two daughters. She is a very diligent cook and bake cakes. She also receives orders for cakes and biscuits especially on Aidilfitri. My mother is a very loving person and always speaks gently except when she is angry. My sister and I are very scared if she is already starting to get angry when we are not tidying the house or room. However, the anger does not last long and it will return to normal once the task is completed.</p5></br>
			<br><p5>For your information, I have a sister named Riza Aswani binti Nor Azizi. My sister was born on 16 December 1999 and she is a student at UniKL. She is a very creative and artistic person. Therefore, she furthered her studies in the field of multimedia during her diploma and degree. My sister is a very soft person because she is quite sensitive to things that can disturb her mind. Even so, my sister and I often quarrel especially when borrowing stuff from each other. HAHAHAHA. Feels funny even at the age of 20 we often quarrel over small things. However, I really love my sister because she is the only sibling I have and helped me when I was in trouble.</p5></br> 
			<br><p5>Last but not least, my hope for all my family members is to always be given health and happiness always. Without them, who am I in this world. With this opportunity, I would like to express that I deeply love my family members and hope they can be with me forever. Not only that, I also hope that I can repay the good deeds of my parents one day. Aamiin..</p5></br>
