				<h3>My Educational Journey</h3>
				<br><p2>Hello everyone! Welcome to my educational journey website. Here I will tell you briefly about my educational journey since childhood. Hope everyone enjoys this story and in the meantime can listen to my favourite aesthetic song that is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAAtsbYSnis&t=45s">aesthetic chill music</a></p2></br>
				<br><p2>I started school at the age of 5 in a kindergarten called <B> Pasti Darul Muslimin Jalan Jambu.</B> This kindergarten is close to my old house and I went to school there for only a year. There are variety of interesting subjects as students will be taught how to read Quran, recite letter and so on. Next, at the age of 6, I attended <B>Pra-Sekolah Kebangsaan Meru, Jalan Tap.</B> This is a step before entering the realm of primary school. I really enjoyed going to school there because of the fun atmosphere and the loving teachers. I also made a lot of friends there and that friendship still remains to this day.</p2></br>
				<br><p2>Moreover, at the age of 7 to 12, I went to school at <B> Sekolah Kebangsaan Meru </B> and <B> SRA Meru II. </B> These two schools have different time sessions. For example, Sekolah Kebangsaan Meru, I go to school in the morning until noon from 7:30 am to 1:20 pm. While SRA Meru II, I go to school in the afternoon from 2.30 pm to 5.30 pm.These two schools provide different subjects. For example, Sekolah Kebangsaan Meru has subjects such as Malay language, Mathematics, English and various other subjects. While SRA Meru II provides subjects that involve knowledge in Islam such as Fiqh, Morality and so on.</p2></br>
				<br><p2>After successfully getting UPSR and PSRA results during primary school, I chose to go to <B> Sekolah Kebangsaan (P) Kapar </B> which is a school for girls only and is a regular day school. I went to school there from the age of 13 to 17 and took account streams during SPM. Various interesting experiences gained while attending school there as I became very comfortable to do anything especially in sports activities.</p2></br>
				<br><p2>In 2018, I finished school and entered university in July 2019. With the SPM results released in March 2019, I was offered to enter a public university in Malaysia namely <B> Universiti Teknologi Mara </B><a href="https://uitm.edu.my/index.php/en/">UiTM</a>in Rembau, Negeri Sembilan. I was offered an Information Management course for two and a half year. However, not everything planned will work as expected. I only went to class physically in semester one and in semester two it ways only four weeks. This is because, the pandemic that hit one world and the situation is forcing all students to study online. I will be finishing this diploma session in February 2022. May everything go smoothly and get execellent results by the end of this semester.</p2></br>
				<br><p2>So, here is a short story about the journey of education in my life. I hope one day I have an opportunity to further my studies to the degree level in the field that I am interested in.</p2></br>
